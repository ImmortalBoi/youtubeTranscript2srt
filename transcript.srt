00:0:08,000 --> 00:0:12,000
PSG is a club that has been growing for ten, eleven years,

2
00:0:12,000 --> 00:0:14,000
it has been growing a lot,

3
00:0:14,000 --> 00:0:19,000
it has a lot of ambition and a lot of desire to continue growing,

4
00:0:19,000 --> 00:0:22,000
it has a lot of room for growth,

5
00:0:22,000 --> 00:0:25,000
it has a lot of power to be able to do so.

6
00:0:25,000 --> 00:0:29,000
I think that today it is one of the biggest clubs in the world

7
00:0:29,000 --> 00:0:35,000
and there is not further to go, it is developing even more and getting bigger.

8
00:0:35,000 --> 00:0:44,000
I think that today it has nothing to envy from thebig and historic clubs.

9
00:0:44,000 --> 00:0:47,000
Winning the Champions League is complicated

10
00:0:47,000 --> 00:0:51,000
because it is a competition where the best are playing,

11
00:0:51,000 --> 00:0:55,000
because any detail, any mistake can knock you out of

12
00:0:55,000 --> 00:1:02,000
a competition, competing against such great clubs and teams.

13
00:1:02,000 --> 00:1:07,000
I think we have the team to try to win it.

14
00:1:07,000 --> 00:1:10,000
I think we are very excited

15
00:1:10,000 --> 00:1:13,000
and we are very eager to achieve it,

16
00:1:13,000 --> 00:1:15,000
but we have to be calm,

17
00:1:15,000 --> 00:1:19,000
because as I say, it is difficult to win the Champions League.

18
00:1:19,000 --> 00:1:22,000
The best team doesn't always win

19
00:1:22,000 --> 00:1:26,000
and you have to be aware of all the details and make a great team,

20
00:1:26,000 --> 00:1:31,000
because in the end the strong teams are the ones that achieve their goals.

21
00:1:31,000 --> 00:1:34,000
And we are on the way

22
00:1:34,000 --> 00:1:43,000
and we are looking to make the team even stronger.

23
00:1:43,000 --> 00:1:47,000
Well, Di María, Ney, I already know them from the National Team

24
00:1:47,000 --> 00:1:51,000
and Ney in the past. At Barcelona we played together.

25
00:1:51,000 --> 00:1:54,000
Kylian, I didn't know him on or off the field.

26
00:1:54,000 --> 00:1:59,000
And well, little by little we are getting to know each other much better

27
00:1:59,000 --> 00:2:05,000
and above all getting to know each other on the field

28
00:2:05,000 --> 00:2:09,000
to see how we feel comfortable with each other.

29
00:2:09,000 --> 00:2:13,000
And obviously it is very nice to be on the field with the best.

30
00:2:13,000 --> 00:2:16,000
I was lucky enough to do it for a long time at Barcelona,

31
00:2:16,000 --> 00:2:20,000
to have the good fortune to always play with the best,

32
00:2:20,000 --> 00:2:22,000
and now it's my turn to do it at Paris as well.

33
00:2:22,000 --> 00:2:30,000
So I'm happy and I'm looking forward to continuing doing this.

34
00:2:30,000 --> 00:2:33,000
It's a very special stadium because of the way the people live it,

35
00:2:33,000 --> 00:2:37,000
how they live the matches, the way they are

36
00:2:37,000 --> 00:2:42,000
always singing for the whole 90 minutes.

37
00:2:42,000 --> 00:2:45,000
I had already experienced it when I came here as a rival,

38
00:2:45,000 --> 00:2:48,000
when I had to come many times with Barcelona.

39
00:2:48,000 --> 00:2:52,000
And well, now I have it every weekend, every week.

40
00:2:52,000 --> 00:2:54,000
The truth is that it is very nice.

41
00:2:54,000 --> 00:3:01,000
You can hear them because they do not stop for a minute singing continuously.

42
00:3:01,000 --> 00:3:07,000
The explosion of a goal, it’s a closed stadium where everything reverberates.
