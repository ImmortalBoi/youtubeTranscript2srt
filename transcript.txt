PSG is a club that has been growing for ten, eleven years,
0:12
it has been growing a lot,
0:14
it has a lot of ambition and a lot of desire to continue growing,
0:19
it has a lot of room for growth,
0:22
it has a lot of power to be able to do so.
0:25
I think that today it is one of the biggest clubs in the world
0:29
and there is not further to go, it is developing even more and getting bigger.
0:35
I think that today it has nothing to envy from thebig and historic clubs.
0:44
Winning the Champions League is complicated
0:47
because it is a competition where the best are playing,
0:51
because any detail, any mistake can knock you out of
0:55
a competition, competing against such great clubs and teams.
1:02
I think we have the team to try to win it.
1:07
I think we are very excited
1:10
and we are very eager to achieve it,
1:13
but we have to be calm,
1:15
because as I say, it is difficult to win the Champions League.
1:19
The best team doesn't always win
1:22
and you have to be aware of all the details and make a great team,
1:26
because in the end the strong teams are the ones that achieve their goals.
1:31
And we are on the way
1:34
and we are looking to make the team even stronger.
1:43
Well, Di María, Ney, I already know them from the National Team
1:47
and Ney in the past. At Barcelona we played together.
1:51
Kylian, I didn't know him on or off the field.
1:54
And well, little by little we are getting to know each other much better
1:59
and above all getting to know each other on the field
2:05
to see how we feel comfortable with each other.
2:09
And obviously it is very nice to be on the field with the best.
2:13
I was lucky enough to do it for a long time at Barcelona,
2:16
to have the good fortune to always play with the best,
2:20
and now it's my turn to do it at Paris as well.
2:22
So I'm happy and I'm looking forward to continuing doing this.
2:30
It's a very special stadium because of the way the people live it,
2:33
how they live the matches, the way they are
2:37
always singing for the whole 90 minutes.
2:42
I had already experienced it when I came here as a rival,
2:45
when I had to come many times with Barcelona.
2:48
And well, now I have it every weekend, every week.
2:52
The truth is that it is very nice.
2:54
You can hear them because they do not stop for a minute singing continuously.
3:01
The explosion of a goal, it’s a closed stadium where everything reverberates.
3:07
So that was very nice, that moment.
